# Postman installer script

## Description

As the installation and update of Postman native app is not automatic on Linux,
here is a small script to download the last version.

Personal Postman data are not saved into the downloaded sources, so it erases
the previous installed version without losing your configuration.

It will install Postman in /opt directory.

## Requirements

* wget
* tar
* sudo permission

## Usage

* Download this script
* Execute the postman_install.sh script
* Make a shortcut in your app launchers (depends on your distribution)
